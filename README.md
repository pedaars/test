## Coding Test

CoInvestor has a demo API available at http://demo.api.coinvestor.co.uk that you can use to get basic platform data.

As an example, http://demo.api.coinvestor.co.uk/sponsor returns a list of fund managers that all have profiles on the platform. You can see an example of this on our [Live Site])https://www.coinvestor.co.uk/managers).
